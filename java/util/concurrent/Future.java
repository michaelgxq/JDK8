/**
 * A {@code Future} represents the result of an asynchronous
 * computation.  Methods are provided to check if the computation is
 * complete, to wait for its completion, and to retrieve the result of
 * the computation.  The result can only be retrieved using method
 * {@code get} when the computation has completed, blocking if
 * necessary until it is ready.  Cancellation is performed by the
 * {@code cancel} method.  Additional methods are provided to
 * determine if the task completed normally or was cancelled. Once a
 * computation has completed, the computation cannot be cancelled.
 * If you would like to use a {@code Future} for the sake
 * of cancellability but not provide a usable result, you can
 * declare types of the form {@code Future<?>} and
 * return {@code null} as a result of the underlying task.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Sample Usage</b> (Note that the following classes are all
 * made-up.)
 * <pre> {@code
 * interface ArchiveSearcher { String search(String target); }
 * class App {
 *   ExecutorService executor = ...
 *   ArchiveSearcher searcher = ...
 *   void showSearch(final String target)
 *       throws InterruptedException {
 *     Future<String> future
 *       = executor.submit(new Callable<String>() {
 *         public String call() {
 *             return searcher.search(target);
 *         }});
 *     displayOtherThings(); // do other things while searching
 *     try {
 *       displayText(future.get()); // use future
 *     } catch (ExecutionException ex) { cleanup(); return; }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * The {@link FutureTask} class is an implementation of {@code Future} that
 * implements {@code Runnable}, and so may be executed by an {@code Executor}.
 * For example, the above construction with {@code submit} could be replaced by:
 *  <pre> {@code
 * FutureTask<String> future =
 *   new FutureTask<String>(new Callable<String>() {
 *     public String call() {
 *       return searcher.search(target);
 *   }});
 * executor.execute(future);}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions taken by the asynchronous computation
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"> <i>happen-before</i></a>
 * actions following the corresponding {@code Future.get()} in another thread.
 *
 * @see FutureTask
 * @see Executor
 * @since 1.5
 * @author Doug Lea
 * @param <V> The result type returned by this Future's {@code get} method

     * 如果
     * 调用该方法的时候该线程任务还没有执行，那么该线程任务将不会再被执行
     * 如果
     * 该线程任务已经开始执行了，那么该方法的形参 mayInterruptIfRunning 将会决定该线程任务是否会被中断
     *（即 Callable<V> 接口中的 call() 方法是否会抛出 InterruptedException 异常）
     *
     * 在该方法调用之后，再调用该 Future<V> 接口中的 isDone() 方法时，isDone() 方法将返回 true
